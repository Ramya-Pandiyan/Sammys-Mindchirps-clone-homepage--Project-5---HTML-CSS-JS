                            Love is an emotion that has always
                            intrigued me.
                            It is loaded with lot of contrarian feelings- 
                            you need the person you love to be possessive about you yet
                            need your space; you need that person to respect your thoughts
                            and let you do things on your course yet you want that person 
                            to offer their unsolicited views, and I could go on and on about
                            how this universal feeling called "LOVE" is so unfathomable.
                            Perhaps, this is why, no matter how many movies are done 
                            around the central theme of love, new ones with fresh 
                            perspective like "Lover" still is celebrated by the audience.

                            None likes facing crisis in life but we all know 
                 that it is inevitable though it's form and severity
                  may vary. Some crisis could impact self while some
                   like Covid 19 could impact people at large. 
                   Darwin's theory of evolution talks about survival 
                   of the fittest, which emphasizes on the adaptablity 
                   to the adverse situations as a quintessential quality
                    to live to see another day. This theory is very much
                     and all the more relevant in present scenario given
                      the VUCA (volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous)
                       nature of the world. But what are the essential qualities,
                        you may wonder. Thanks to the authors T N Hari

                How travel can change one's outlook about life.
                 Of late, in Kollywood cinema, this pattern can
                  be seen where there is a depressed person(men,
                   mostly) who would climb on their Royal Enfield
                    bike and then set off to the Himalayan
                     mountains; when they return, they become
                      a refined soul. So, is this movie any 
                      different from the stereotypical portrayal?! 
                      Ah, you can't get to the

                            It's a common saying which goes like 'Marriages are made in
                 Heaven'; but we all know that the 
                 couple should still lead their lives on
                  (beautiful yet complicated) Earth!! All of us 
                  want and yearn for a happy, peaceful, fun 
                  filled and satisfying married life and a
                   partner who would support, defend, and
                    handhold us in this journey. But very 
                    rarely do we come across couples who have
                     achieved this stature.
                      This book 'Row, Row, Row your Boat' is
                       a book written by couple therapists,
                        Sophia and Roopak(a couple themselves!!), 
                        who turned around their married life which 
                        was on the verge of collapse with therapy's
                         help. This is a short but insightful read 
                         on little things that couples
                          could do 'together' to reach their 
                          vision of becoming a made-for-each-other
                           couple, which apparently was their
                            original vow when they got married
                  but may have fizzled out as years passed by.

                            Let's assume this situation. You are working 
                in a reputed organization and your appraisal 
                is underway. You have high hopes of getting a
                 sizeable increment with a promotion to a 
                 leadership role. All of a sudden, your manager
                  invites you into his room and asks you to 
                  poach some information to a competitor 
                  firm for some illegal commission. Would 
                  you be okay doing this so that your appraisal
                   sails through, which will also keep you 
                   in your manager's good books or would you 
                   back off as you would be hurting the
                    organization for illegal short term again. 
                    This is just an example of one of plethora
                     of daily dilemmas that life throws at you 
                     with varying complexities. 
                     This book by Hardayal Singh, a 
                     civil service Officer, attempts to
                      highlight through fictional and real 
                      stories of common men, that choosing 
                      and walking along the righteous path 
                      with an unwavering 
                      mind is possible
                 but acknowledges that it is extremely difficult.

            find interesting (with my two cents, of course :D).
